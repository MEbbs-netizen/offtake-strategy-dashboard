    - **Zonal** models reveal regional arbitrage opportunities and pricing risks.

    - Solar and Wind CfDs show different performance depending on their zone â€” use model to guide location-based contracting.

    - Match project locations to strategy: coastal wind â†’ CfD; high-sun, high-price regions â†’ Merchant Solar or PPA.
    - Use revenue projections and stress tests to model risk.
    - Use optimization results to benchmark strategy robustness across zones and contracts.
    - Leverage insights from subsidy and ROI charts to prioritize investments.
